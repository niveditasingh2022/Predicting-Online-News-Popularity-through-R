## **Introduction**

### **Domain**
The dataset, "Online News Popularity," was sourced from Mashable, a widely-read online news platform. It contains information on over 35,000 news articles published over two years. Popularity is quantified by the number of shares an article receives on social media platforms.

### **Dataset Structure**
The dataset includes 61 attributes, categorized as follows:
- **General Attributes**: Token counts, word lengths, and title characteristics.
- **Content Details**: Number of images, videos, references, and keywords.
- **News Information**: Category (e.g., lifestyle, business, technology) and publication timing.
- **Analytical Details**: LDA analysis, polarity, subjectivity, and sentiment measures.

### **Project Objectives**
The main objectives are:
1. Understand the factors influencing online news popularity.
2. Build a predictive model to estimate an article’s popularity.
3. Evaluate model performance using metrics such as MSE and R².
4. Explore various techniques like cross-validation and bootstrapping to ensure robustness.

## **Approach**

### **Problem Understanding**
The goal is to predict online news popularity by constructing a multivariate regression model using shares as the dependent variable.

### **Data Understanding**
The dataset was explored to:
- Analyze feature distributions and relationships.
- Identify correlations using visualizations such as heatmaps and scatterplots.

### **Data Preparation**
Key preprocessing steps included:
1. Handling missing values and outliers.
2. Converting categorical variables.
3. Selecting relevant features for modeling.

### **Modeling and Evaluation**
Regression models were built and evaluated using metrics like:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² (Coefficient of Determination)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

Techniques like cross-validation and bootstrapping were applied to assess model performance and ensure reliability.

## **Solution**

### **Data Exploration**
Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis were performed to understand feature distributions and relationships. Key visualizations include histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps.

### **Building a Regression Model**
- A multivariate linear regression model was built using preprocessed data.
- Techniques like feature selection and transformations were applied to enhance model performance.
- Cross-validation and bootstrapping were used for robust evaluation.

### **Model Evaluation**
Performance metrics calculated include:
- **MSE**: Measures prediction error.
- **R²**: Indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model.
- **MAE/MAPE/MPE**: Assess absolute and percentage errors.
- ANOVA was used to compare models and identify the best predictors.

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the factors influencing online news popularity and provides actionable insights into predicting article shares. By leveraging regression models, cross-validation, and bootstrapping, the analysis highlights the significance of feature engineering and evaluation in building predictive frameworks. These findings can guide content creators and marketers in optimizing strategies for audience engagement.
